**Contract via Aquent at Facebook** (2018 - 2019)


Contract to deliver LogDevice Open Source, making a key component of Facebook's data-infrastructure available for use and contribution by the open source community



* Port LogDevice to CMake build environment; allowing development outside Facebook infrastructure.

* Configured Travis and then CircleCI CI pipelines for LogDevice compiling, unit and system testing publishing to images to DockerHub and documents to GitHub. Allowing rapid signal for developers of the impact of their diffs on LogDevice-OSS.

* Creation of Debian packages for LogDevice; to allow rapid installation.

* Internal CI pipelines using Facebook infrastructure to give internal developers feedback on every diff.

* Ported FBThrift-py3 to open source, the first Cython compiled open source offering from Facebook and a key component in opening many more projects to the community in its position as a building block for Facebook systems and services

* Delivered a complete set of demonstrator services used to support the sales team in winning opportunities; including developing the ground-breaking concept of using an Amino STB as the cable to IP turn-around acting as the content source for the Amino's first AWS hosted CloudTV service

* Developed automatic build and release systems to assure the stability of the common code base, aligning build and release processes to eliminating release day delays due to broken configuration

* Migrated software development from CVS to Git including retention of complete version history allowing developers to take advantage of modern version control tool while retaining the ability to go back and understand the decisions behind code implementation.

* Developed and maintained Debian packages for toolchains and common development tools ensuring a consistent build environment and hence reducing developer time tracking down machine specific bugs

* Ensured developer communication, regular knowledge sharing as Scrum Master and team lead for AmiNET firmware, and later AVG (Audio, Video and Graphics) teams

* Developed the company's first Scrum tool using MySQL, perl, HTML and Javascript, automatically synchronised with TestTrack Bug-Tracker allowing consistent prioritised backlogs for each team and reducing administrative burden
